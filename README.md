CriC - connhelping people

We have given to humanity a great help. The need to seek and help the ones in need has never been so high until our days. Danger is waiting at any corner. We provide you a platform to search people and recive notifications about recent hazardous events. You can now, at a touch of a finger or, if you like, at a click of a mouse find most useful information about you all. 

We have integrated one of world's most faimous map, Google Crisis Map, the one that has you back up. The map is live and you can see in live what's happening all around the world. You can check your location for weather conditions, like tornados, hurricanes, flooding and forst fires.
